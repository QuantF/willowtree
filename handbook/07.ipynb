    "## Applications to Derivatives Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "To many problems in financial engineering, numerical methods are the only viable solution. Relying on a solid algorithm is key for market participants, because the quality of the estimates makes the difference between profit and loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valuation procedure leads to acceptable results if and only if the adopted lattice is valid. A valid lattice is one that generates estimates of increasing precision when its structure gets finer and finer. In the limit, these estimates should converge to the true, often unknown price of the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Willow Tree Is A Valid Lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "The willow tree achieves convergence to the true price of the derivative by focusing on the standard Brownian motion, the driver of the stock price process and the only source of risk in the Black-Scholes-Merton environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the value of a European, plain vanilla call option depends on the final price of the stock. This, in turn, is a function of $W(T)$, the value of the standard Brownian motion at the expiry date:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "c = \\bigg[&\\boxed{S_T}\\mathcal{N}(d_1)-K\\mathcal{N}(d_2)\\bigg]\\cdot e^{-rT}\\nonumber\\\\\n",
    "&\\ S_T=S_0\\exp{\\bigg\\{\\Big(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\Big)T+\\sigma \\boxed{W(T)}\\ \\bigg\\}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, for an accurate valuation of derivatives, the proxy for the standard Brownian motion must be reliable. In the willow tree lattice framework, this occurs if and only if the discrete Markov process $\\big\\{Y_{t_k}\\big\\}_{k=0}^n$ (see [The Discrete Process Y](04.ipynb)) converges to the desired distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As conjectured by Ho [8], and later proven by Haussmann and Yan [7], $\\big\\{Y_{t_k}\\big\\}_{k=0}^n$ meets such requirement when the number of space nodes goes to infinity, $m\\to\\infty$, and the length of time increments goes to zero, $h\\to0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\big\\{Y_{t_k}\\big\\}_{k=0}^n\\ \\to\\ W(t),\\qquad m\\to\\infty,\\quad h\\to0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equation holds for $Y_{t_k}$, for each time step, all suitable mappings of this process must also converge to their respective distributions. For example, for an adequately fine grid, the stock price process $S_{t_k}=S\\big(Y_{t_k}\\big)$ must follow the geometric Brownian motion, for all $t_k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{t_k}=S_0\\exp{\\bigg\\{\\Big(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\Big)t_k+\\sigma Y_{t_k}\\bigg\\}}\\ \\to\\ S(t)=S_0\\exp{\\bigg\\{\\Big(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\Big)t_k+\\sigma W(t)\\bigg\\}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter equation is particularly relevant: it ensures that the willow tree is a fruitful pricing technique, and justifies its use in derivative valuation."
