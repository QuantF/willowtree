    "The willow tree lattice is a computer library explicitly designed to mimic the behaviour of the __standard Brownian motion__. The algorithm does so in two steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it adopts a grid structure which extends in both time and space and which defines the nodes of the process. When probability is attached to them, these nodes represent, for each time step, a discrete approximation of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, it links sequences in adjacent time periods with a discrete Markov process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall system converges to the standard Brownian motion as the grid becomes finer in both dimensions. Within the willow tree framework, space and time steps do not have any reciprocal dependence. On the one hand, the steps, particularly in the time dimension, need not be uniform; on the other, to achieve convergence the double limit is required."

    "$\\mathbf{z}$, the vector of representative standard normal variates, has values selected through _stratified sampling_ [6]. This technique, which Curran had already used in a previous paper [2], refers to the process of sampling from a population previously divided into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subgroups, or _strata_. Let $\\Phi$ denote the standard normal cumulative distribution function on the real line, and $\\Phi^{-1}$ its inverse. Given probabilities $\\{q_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ summing to 1, define a sequence $\\{a_i\\}_{i=0}^{m}$ of quantiles of the standard normal distribution as follows:\n",
